## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-07 (Day 1, ticket PPA-1)

### Added
- Project skeleton: `src/` layout, `pyproject.toml`, Makefile, CI workflow, MIT licence.
- `config/project.toml` with market, date range, SDAC price limits (floor -500 to
  -600 EUR/MWh from delivery day 29 May 2026) and reconciliation references.
- Energy-Charts API client with timeouts, exponential back-off and `Retry-After`
  handling for HTTP 429; pure parsers for prices and generation.
- Raw monthly Parquet cache with manifests (parameters, checksum, licence, completeness).
- Processed datasets: native-resolution prices, hourly prices, 15-minute and hourly generation.
- DST-aware data-quality checks, including a night-time solar check that catches time-zone bugs.
- Annual statistics, reconciliation against published figures, Day 1 report with four charts.
- 52 offline tests using real API fixtures (94% coverage); one opt-in live contract test.
- `make docs`: learning-track pages rendered to PDF with headless Chrome.

### Fixed during development
- pandas 3 infers datetime units: interval lengths are now computed from time
  differences, and all indexes are normalised to nanoseconds.
- The API returns HTTP 429 with `Retry-After`; the client now waits as instructed.
